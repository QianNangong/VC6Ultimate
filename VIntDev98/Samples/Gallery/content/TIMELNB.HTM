<P>This sample uses three files:</P>

</FONT>
<UL>
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>
    <LI>TLFish.htm contains the Timeline control and other functions to control 
    the objects on the page. </LI>
    <LI>FishLeft.gif is an animated GIF of a fish swimming to the left. </LI>
    <LI>FishRght.gif is an animated GIF of a fish swimming to the right. 
    </LI>

</FONT></UL>
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>
<P>The Timeline control fires events that call JavaScript 
functions to control the fish and change the Z-order of the seaweed. 
<P>The following code is called by the Timeline control 
when the fish is about to swim to the right. Before the fish begins to swim, the 
Z-order of the seaweed is changed, the animated GIF of the fish swimming left 
(FishLeft.gif) is hidden, the animated GIF of the fish swimming right 
(FishRght.gif) becomes visible. Then the function calls the play method of the 
Timeline control to start the animation.</P>
<P><FONT face=Courier>function 
Swim_goRight()<BR>
{<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
plant2.style.zIndex=-2 //make plant2 move to the back<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; plant1.style.zIndex=1 //make plant1 move to the foreground<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; plant3.style.zIndex=1 //make plant3 move to 
the foreground<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
fishl.style.visibility=&quot;hidden&quot;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
fishr.style.visibility=&quot;visible&quot;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Right.play()<BR>
}<BR>
</FONT>

<P>The Timeline control will then call another JavaScript 
function that will move the fish 5 pixels every 100ms:</P>
<P><FONT face=Courier>var moveInc = 
5<BR>
function Right_frameRight()<BR>
{<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; fishr.style.left = 
fishr.style.pixelLeft + moveInc <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
fishl.style.left = fishl.style.pixelLeft + moveInc <BR>
}<BR>
</FONT>

<P>When the fish has gotten to the right side of the 
screen, the Timeline control will use similar functions to make the fish swim to 
the left.
